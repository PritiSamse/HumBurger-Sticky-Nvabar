         Especially in a developing country like India with a population of more than 136 crores, education is the key to a better standard of living 
         and a prosperous future. Not to mention, education is the right of every citizen of India. In this blog, you will read about the importance 
         of education in India and the role of education in Indian society.Importantly, education secures a bright and prosperous future for educated 
         individuals. It also helps in mitigating crime and terrorism. In Ancient India, Education was considered to be sacred and teachers were 
         given the utmost respect by everyone. Education in Ancient India consisted of both physical development and learning.

            Educational growth refers to how much students are growing in their proficiency as they move through the school system. A trend is
             a pattern made over time by the results from a like group. Growth and trend information is important for teachers, education policymakers
              and policy analysts.

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society.
         In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or enculturation. Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, 
         the Renaissance Florentines,  or the middle classes of Manhattan—are born without culture.Education is designed to guide them in learning a culture, 
         molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood,  and directing them toward their eventual role in society. In the most primitive cultures,
          there is often little formal learning—little of what  one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead, the entire environment and all 
          activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all adults act as teachers. As societies grow more complex, however, 
          the quantity of knowledge to be passed on from one generation to the next becomes more than any one person can know, and, hence,
           there must evolve more selective and efficient means of cultural transmission. The outcome is formal education—the school and the specialist
            called the teacher</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is one of the most vital and crucial parts of our growth and development. In fact, education plays 
        a significant role in molding our ideology and personality. It shapes us to become citizens of the future and contribute to the well-being
         of society. In this blog, you will get to explore the need and importance of environmental education for our society and the significant 
         role it plays in shaping our careers and our future. We will also explore the different types of education like health, consumer, value-based,
          human rights, and much more!The human mind makes possible all development achievements, from health advances and agricultural innovations
           to efficient public administration and private sector growth. For countries to reap these benefits fully, they need to unleash the potential 
           of the human mind. And there is no better tool for doing so than education.
